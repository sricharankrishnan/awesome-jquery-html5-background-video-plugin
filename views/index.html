      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>
        JLBP assumes that you have prior knowledge of how to work with jekyll. In case you don't, please click on the link below that 
        takes you to their website. You also need to have jekyll locally installed in your system (with version 4.0) along with ruby. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Do checkout the installation process with the jekyll website. If you already have these details ready, you can proceed to the next step.

      <h2>The JLBP Tree</h2>
      <p>
        The JLBP Tree represents the directory structure for the project scaffolding. Each portion/directory/file has a purpose. Some of them needs to be removed for you to use when it comes to building your
        projects. You can refer to this tree image (link below) when you need to get started with using JLBP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets now get you focused on what you need to do to start working with JLBP.

    </div>
    <div class="segment">
      <h2>Download The JLBP Scaffolding</h2>
      <p>
        JBLP can be downloaded from its github remote. You can start off by typing
        <code>git clone git@github.com:sricharankrishnan/jekyll-lava-boilerplate.git [./your-project-directory-name]</code> to get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allow the download process to complete and once this is done, proceed into your project directory name with <span class="orange">cd ./your-project-name</span> and 
        follow along with the rest of the details below.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="segment">
      <h2>Remove These Files and Settings</h2>
      <p>
        Run terminal command <code>npm run cleanup</code> post the download <em>(possible because JLBP comes with a package.json file which you will see in the next section)</em>. This command helps to remove certain unwanted files and remotes.
        The list of details that are being removed from this scaffolding are listing below for your information:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled defaultList">
        <li>
          <strong>The Github Remote:</strong>
          This project has a github remote from which you may have clone the scaffolding. Please perform <code>git remote remove origin</code>.
          You can set your own respective github remotes for your projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unwanted Files:</strong>
          <span class="orange">CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</span>, 
          <span class="orange">CONTRIBUTING.md</span>, 
          <span class="orange">LICENSE</span>, 
          <span class="orange">README.md</span>, 
          <span class="orange">googleac250e85da349e6d.html</span> - are all files that may not be suitable for your project. These files are particularly used 
          for hosting this project with Github/Google search console.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cannonical Link Tag (Requires Manual Removal!)</strong>
          Head to the <span class="orange">_layouts/default.html</span> file, remove
          <code>&lt;link href="https://jekyll-lava-boilerplater.netlify.com/" rel="cannonical"/&gt;</code> as this is also applicable for
          the JLBP project.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With all of these details removed, lets now look at starting the server on your local machine.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="segment">
      <h2>Package.json and Server Start</h2>
      <p>
        JLBP comes with a package.json file. It has a couple of commands that you can use (in the scripts property) that makes it easy to 
        run the server. They are:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled defaultList">
        <li>
          <strong><code>npm run dev</code></strong>
          This is the standard and basic command that you can run on the terminal to start the jekyll server. A watch is kept on all files in 
          your projects and will automatically update the build.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><code>npm run devhost</code></strong>
          Similar to the previous command but the difference being that you can see your jekyll website on a another device as long as you are 
          on the same Wifi connection. The availability of this feature is purely dependent on Jekyll itself and is not propreitary to JLBP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><code>npm run hotreload</code></strong>
          Helps to run the server like npm run dev but will auto refresh your browser once you save changes in your project file(s).
          The availability of this feature is purely dependent on Jekyll itself and is not propreitary to JLBP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><code>npm run build</code></strong>
          Performs the required build process. This will help to generate the required static files, once ready, you can then check out 
          the <span class="orange">_site</span> directory for the folders and files that you can use to place it in a server or hosting area for your 
          live website.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you've removed all unwanted files and remote links mentioned from the previous section, you should be able to start the server with 
        any one of the commands above. When you do open your browser with <span class="orange">http://localhost:4000/</span>, you should be 
        able to see this exact same page.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that you're set. Lets now see some of the features of JBLP in the following section

    <div class="segment">
      <h2>Assets Directory</h2>
      <p>
        This directory has been created with the idea of housing all static assets. These would normally be files that are images, videos, stylesheets, javascript 
        files and more. If you have a look at the directory (in javascript for example), you'd see that it even houses jquery and bootstrap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider this to be a good place to store vendor requirements and depenedencies as well.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="segment">
      <h2>View Directory</h2>
      <p>
        All page related html files originate from this folder. This place represents the main body of a particular page. From here, we can call on 
        jekyll features like <span class="orange"><code>{&#x25 include some-partial-file.html &#x25}</code></span> ifyou like to render a partial file into your main body.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you run the build command all page content files are finally built from the files housed in this directory.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="segment">
      <h2>Rel Base</h2>
      <p>
        Rel Base is a feature that was picked up from <a href="https://ricostacruz.com/til/relative-paths-in-jekyll" target="_blank"><span class="orange">here</span></a>.
        Its very useful in providing the much needed relative path builds to connect your file requirements with the main html file. Would encourage that you 
        read through that blog for more information.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="segment">
      <h2>The Compress HTML File</h2>
      <p>
        The compress.html file located in./ _layouts directory helps in compressing the HTML file that is finally being rendered on the browser. Note that this is actually achieved 
        by initiailizing ./_layouts/default.html file with the needed front matter on top, otherwise it won't work.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="segment">
      <h2>A Note on the Directory Structure</h2>
      <p>
        From the initial days, its been found necessary to have a good directory structure to keep things in place. Thus as a result, directories like <code>_sass</code> 
        for example, have certain files split up into folders inside of it. The <b>modules</b> directory houses the <code>_variables.scss</code> and <code>_mixins.scss</code> files. You can open these up 
        to see their contents, add new variables or mixins. Perhaps you may even want to add a file of a similar nature or purpose in this folder.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>vendor-components</code> refers to directories or folders that have third party files as dependencies. The <code>_sass</code> directory houses bootstrap inside this and <code>assets</code> directory houses 
        jquery and others. Again, you could choose to have files of similar nature (3rd party sass files) and keep them here for importing into your page files.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>common</code> directory is kept to house all common styles for the entire web site/static web app. You can add additional or new styles for your app's navigation, footer section and 
        all other common styles applicable. These can then be imported. Take a look at <code>./assets/css/home-page.scss</code> file to see what is being done to get an understanding.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="segment">
      <h2>What about the others you ask?</h2>
      <p>
        All other folders and files like <span class="orange">404.html</span>, <span class="orange">_config.yml</span>, 
        <span class="orange">Gemfile</span>, <span class="orange">Gemfile.lock</span>, <span class="orange">_includes</span>, 
        <span class="orange">_layouts</span>, <span class="orange">_sass</span>, <span class="orange">_site</span> are all a part of the original 
        build from Jekyll. Like mentioned earlier, you'd need to have some understanding of how jekyll works in order to get this parts as well.
